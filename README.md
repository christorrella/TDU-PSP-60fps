# 60fps Cheat for Test Drive Unlimited PSP

Increases the game's refresh rate from 20fps to 60fps

# Compatibility

I found this cheat originally made [here](https://forums.ppsspp.org/showthread.php?tid=4799&pid=118438#pid118438), but it was broken for the USA / ULUS10249 region version, so I fixed it.

This cheat has only been tested with PPSSPP. It has not been tested on a PS Vita. 

# Installation

1. Copy the ULUS10249.ini file into the "Cheats" directory for PPSSPP  (or copy its contents into an existing ULUS10249.ini file)
2. Enable Cheats in PPSSPP's System Settings
3. Enable the cheat in the PPSSPP pause menu under "Cheats"

After completing the above steps, restart the game (or else you may experience issues).

If the cheat is enabled before the game is started, a restart of the game is not required.
